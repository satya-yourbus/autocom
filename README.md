Automatically communicate the github commit information to slack, jira and archive the commit messages as a google drive document

This is to automate the communication channel between engineering and other teams inside the organization and help them be on the same page without needing a manual intervention. Currently, for every commit in stage and master branches, it automatically sends notifications to slack, jira etc.
