# Capitalized, short (50 chars or less) summary
#
# More detailed explanatory text, if necessary. Add reference to JIRA
# cards in the commit message. Otherwise, the commit will be ignored.
# In some contexts, the first line is treated as the subject of an email
# and the rest of the text as the body.  The blank line separating the summary
# from the body is critical. Check spellings in your commit message.
#
# Further paragraphs come after blank lines.
#
#	- Bullet points are okay, too
#
#	- Typically a hyphen or asterisk is used for the bullet, preceded by a
#     single space, with blank lines in between, but conventions vary here
#
#	- Use a hanging indent
