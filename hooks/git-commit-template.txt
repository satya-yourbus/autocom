# Capitalized, short (50 chars or less) summary
#
# More detailed explanatory text, if necessary. Add reference to JIRA
# cards (e.g., ZS-1234), PRDs, Known Issues, Database Queries etc
# in the commit message. Otherwise, the commit will be ignored.
#
# The blank line separating the summary from the body is critical.
#
# Check spellings in your commit message.
#
# Further paragraphs come after blank lines.
#
# - Bullet points are okay, too
#
# - Typically a hyphen or asterisk is used for the bullet, preceded by a
#     single space, with blank lines in between, but conventions vary here
#
# - Use a hanging indent
